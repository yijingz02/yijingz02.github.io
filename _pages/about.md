I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Misha Khodak](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~khodak/index.html), where I work on foundations and applications of machine learning. More recently, I have been working on scaling laws and methods for AI for scientific computing.

Previously, I completed my B.S. in CS also at [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), where I had the honor to work with Prof. [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/) and Dr. [Pedro Morgado](https://pedro-morgado.github.io/).

Research Projects
======

## Project 1: Methods for Domain-specific Fine-tuning for Generative Models

This is an independent research study for my senior honor thesis supervised under [Prof. Frederic Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). It focus on investigating the retrainability of synthetic datasets generated by fine-tuned generative models for domain-specific downstream classification tasks and the fine-tuning efficiency for generating higher-quality synthetic datasets.
Presented my work at [Senior Honors Thesis Symposium 2024](https://honors.ls.wisc.edu/event/senior-honors-thesis-symposium-2024/).

Related Topics: NLP, Foundation models, Generative models, Fine-tuning, Data Efficiency

## Project 2: Audio-Guided Visual Animation

Supervised by [Prof. Pedro Morgado](https://pedro-morgado.github.io/), we worked on highly syncrhonized audio-to-video generation, focusing on generatation of animation with audio guidance.
Resulting paper is in submission to ECCV 2024.

Related Topic: Computer vision, Generative models, Audio-to-Video.

## Project 3: AlignEZ

Supervised by [Prof. Frederic Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/), we worked on self-aligning models without further training. We proposed AlignEZ that uses (1) self-generated preference data; (2) representation editing to provide nearly cost-free alignment.
Resulting paper is in submission to ICLR 2025.

Related Topic: NLP, Alignment. 

## Project 4: CHAMELEON

Supervised by [Prof. Frederic Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/), we worked on utilizing an AlignEZ approach for personalizing LLM. We found that P-ALignEZ is able to perform model larges-scale personalization for multi-users using low resource. Planned submission to ICML 2025.

## Project 5: On Generating Better Quality Instruction Tuning Data

Supervised by [Prof. Bach](https://cs.brown.edu/people/sbach/index.html) and [Prof. Frederic Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/), we focused on research for methods for generating better quality instruction tuning dataset from unannotated text for model tuning.
